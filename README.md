This reposotory  contains  a power-bi dashboard on  the road accident anlaysis

Brief Description :-

In this repository you will see a dashboard on  Road Accident analysis
I have performed some Exploratory Data analsysis(EDA) on the dataset provided

The exploratory data analysis includes :-

1.Data modeling
-It is the process of creating a relationship  between common columns of multiple tables
In this tables I have created one table manually(Name-Adates) which include dates and time and years of Casualties
and create a relation between original data and manually designed table.

2.Data visuallization
It is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations.
In this dashboard,I create some charts and graphs and pictorial representions representing the number or sum of casualties in the previous and current year


3.Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
